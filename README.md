The first repository.
Hello friends,

Brett here. Forty-One years old (very old). I have been an IT professional for 11 years. I specialize in systems infrastructure; building network and server systems from greenfield up to usable production environments, systems administration, and management. However; I have never really done any programming aside from scripting in windows environments. I am here to learn; hopefully I am still capable of it. 

Peace and blessings,
Brett
